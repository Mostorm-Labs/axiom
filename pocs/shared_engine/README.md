# POC-01 Shared Engine

This directory is intentionally isolated from future product runtime code. It
proves that one single-threaded C++20 document runtime can replay the same
strict operation stream and produce the same semantic and visual result on
Web/WASM/WebGL2, Windows/D3D12, macOS/iOS/iPadOS Metal, and Android/GLES3.

All C ABI, replay schema, handles, scene structures, and fixtures in this
directory are **Experimental**. R1 will replace them using the evidence
collected by this POC; no source or binary compatibility is promised.

POC-01 was accepted on 2026-08-18 after the six-platform CI, physical
iPhone/iPadOS/Android gates, same-machine Windows/Web hardware gates, and the
fixed-source macOS gate passed the aggregate review. Acceptance validates the
architecture and evidence; it does not promote these experimental interfaces
to product contracts. See the [final gate audit](reports/poc01/FINAL_GATE_AUDIT_2026-08-18.md).

POC-01 is also the minimal operation-driven Document proof: two independent
empty Documents that consume the same historical POC create/move/delete replay
with atomic whole-batch rejection must end at the same sequence and digest. This
does not define a product Transaction model; ADR-0025 makes Operation the sole
canonical product mutation unit. POC-01 does not implement or stabilize a
`DocumentSnapshot` codec, persistent operation log, compaction, undo/redo, or
collaboration protocol; those follow ADR-0020 and later R1/R2/R4 evidence.

## Host-core quick start

```sh
python3 tools/bootstrap_deps.py --core
cmake --preset host-debug
cmake --build --preset host-debug
ctest --preset host-debug
```

The host build exercises Document, Operations, SceneCompiler, XXH3 digest,
the C ABI, a dependency-free software probe, lifecycle, and smoke tests. Only
the pinned Skia raster target owns the visual reference. The native Apple
harness validates Runtime portability without selecting a macOS product shell.

Platform bootstrap, prebuilt SDK targets, Producer profile details, demo usage,
acceptance artifacts, and the manual GPU benchmark process are documented in
[`docs/POC01_RUNBOOK.md`](docs/POC01_RUNBOOK.md).

GPU quick start on Apple silicon uses the immutable SDK rather than Skia
source:

```sh
python3 tools/bootstrap_deps.py --core
python3 tools/skia/fetch.py --target macos-arm64-metal
cmake --preset macos-release
cmake --build --preset macos-release
ctest --preset macos-release
```
